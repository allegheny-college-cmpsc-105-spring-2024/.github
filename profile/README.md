### Course Description

An introduction to the methods of collecting, exploring, transforming and visualizing data for storytelling. Often participating in team-based and hands-on activities, students learn how to use web platforms and dashboards to acquire, explore and investigate data to generate summarized key data insights using visual techniques. Students also apply open-source programming language to discover patterns in the data, test hypotheses, and check assumptions using graphical representations. During a weekly laboratory session, students employ cutting-edge software tools to complete projects, reporting on their results through both written documents and oral presentations. Students are invited to use their own departmentally approved laptop in this course; a limited number of laptops are available for use during class and lab sessions. Prerequisite: None. Distribution Requirements: QR, SP.
